Issue: class-related functions not same as private static methods

http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/matlab/matlab_oop/specifying-methods-and-functions.html?refresh=true#br2la89

private static methods should use dot notation

My interpretation of the Matlab docs if that calling a static method
should require the class name (or instance) and dot notation
("myclass.mystaticmethod()").

Matlab seems to allow you to be sloppy in this way inside your own class
(or at least I can't find it documented anywhere that you are allowed to do this.)


If really you want to use functions without the dot, there is another
feature: "class-related function" which are also private to the m-file
(and not e.g., methods of the class defined in other m-files).
